# Let's Brake Down the individual levels

## Basic Level

### Creating new table
TO create a new table in MS SQL, you need to type 
```sql CREATE TABLE [GiveTable Name] ```

After making table, give attributes,
```sql
CREATE TABLE [GiveTable Name]
( IDNumber int,
  FirstName charvar(50),
  LastName charvar(50),
  Age int)
```
You can replace the names of the attribute to any form(either string or integer) but should mentioned "charvar(50)" for string and "int" for integer.
