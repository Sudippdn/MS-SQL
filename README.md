# MS SQL
### Intoduction:
MS SQL, which stands for Microsoft SQL Server, is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It's a software program that allows you to store, organize, and access data efficiently.

## How to download?
You can visit the official server of Microsoft SQL Server management Studio and install, For shortcut [click here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

# Let's Brake Down the individual levels

## Basic Level

### Creating new table
TO create a new table in MS SQL, you need to type 
``` CREATE TABLE [GiveTable Name] ```

After making table, give attributes,
```sql
CREATE TABLE [GiveTable Name]
( IDNumber int,
  FirstName charvar(50),
  LastName charvar(50),
  Age int)
```
You can replace the names of the attribute to any form(either string or integer) but should mentioned `charvar(50)` for string and `int` for integer.

## SELECT and FROM clauses
SELECT clause specifies the columns from which data values are to be retrieved by the query where as FROM clause specify the table of the database. SELECT and FROM clauses always comes together in structured query language.

The basic syntax of SELECT and FROM clauses is:
```sql
SELECT [Attribute], [Attribute], ...., [Attribute]
FROM [TableName]
```

## SELECT ALL
In SQL, select all can be performed by passing star(*) along with SELECT statement ie `SELECT *`.

For example:
Suppose a table has attributes like, CustomerID, C_FirstName, C_LastName, C_ContactNo, C_Address then instead of choosing like `SELECT CustomerID, C_FirstName, C_LastName, C_ContactNo, C_Address`, we can simply perform `SELECT *`

Operators in SELECT clause:
- MIN --> Gives minimum value from the selected column
- MAX --> Gives maximum value from the selected solumn
- COUNT --> count the similar data selected specified by `GROUP BY` clause
- AVG --> gives average value from the selected caluse
- SUM --> sum all the values of the targeted integer column
- TOP --> Select the top and mentioned number of rows from the table (Same like head in pandas)
- DISTINCT --> Helps to eleminate dublicated from the table

  The above mentioned operators are used to filter the different variation of attributes of the data in a table.
  syntax:
  ```sql
SELECT [operator] ([attribute])
FROM [TableName]
  ```

## INSERT INTO Clause
`INSERT INTO` clause is used to insert the values of the attributes in a existing table. `VALUE` is passed along Table Name. While inserting the values the following syntax is passed:
```sql
INSERT INTO [TableName] VALUES
([value of first attribute], [value of second attribute], ..... [value of Nth attribute]),
([value of first attribute], [value of second attribute], ..... [value of Nth attribute]),
([value of first attribute], [value of second attribute], ..... [value of Nth attribute])
```

## Where Clause
`WHERE` caluse is a cluse which plays a vital role to specify the row while performing various task after passing a certain condition. It is mostly used during deletion, replacing, inserting values, and so on which is based on overall manipulation of data. `WHERE` clause helps us to make sure the selected row is ready to manipulate accourdingly.

Syntax: 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM [TableName]
WHERE [AttributeName] = integer or 'Char' or 'String'
```
## Alise for a column
Alise or alising or AS command is used to rename a column or table with an alias. An alias help to change the name of the column or tableName temperory and only exists for the duration of the query.

## CASE Statement:
I found `CASE` statement is same like `if/else` statement in other programming language like `python` where `WHEN` and `THEN` statements are used instead. There should be at least a pair of `WHEN/THEN` to use `CASE` clauses. The CASE clauses always ends with `END` keyword.

To use to the `CASE` clause, the basic syntax is:
```sql
CASE
	WHEN JobTitle = 'Salesman' Then Salary + (Salary * 0.1)
	WHEN JobTitle = 'Technical' Then Salary + (Salary * 0.1)
	WHEN JobTitle = 'Driver' Then Salary + (Salary * 0.1)
	ELSE Salary + (Salary * 0.8)
END AS SalaryAfterRise
```

## HAVING Clause
While talking about the `HAVING clause`, In MS SQL, the HAVING clause is used to filter groups of data after they have been aggregated using a `GROUP BY` clause. It works in conjunction with aggregate functions `(like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)` to apply conditions to the results of the grouping.

The basic way of using this clause is:
```sql
Select JobTitle, AVG(Salary)	
From SQLProject.dbo.EmployeeDemoGraphics
Join SQLProject.dbo.EmployeeSalary
	ON EmployeeDemoGraphics.EmployeeId = EmployeeSalary.EmployeeID
Group by JobTitle
Having AVG(Salary) > 1
Order by avg(salary)
```
